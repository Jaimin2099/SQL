## Instructions

### 1. Problem Solving (First 60-90 minutes)
- **Assigned Questions:** Each student will receive a set of SQL problems from LeetCode. The problems will cover a mix of easy, medium, and hard queries related to relational databases.
- **Solve the Questions:** Start solving your assigned questions on LeetCode as soon as the session begins. 
  - Use appropriate database concepts such as `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `WHERE`, etc.
  - Ensure that your code runs correctly and efficiently.

### 2. Interview Process (Last 30-60 minutes)
Once you have solved **all** the assigned questions, approach the instructor for the interview.

- **1:1 Interview:** You will sit down with the instructor to discuss your solutions.
- **Explanation:** Be prepared to explain:
  - Your approach to each problem.
  - Your thought process, challenges faced, and how you arrived at the solution.
  - The SQL concepts used and why they were appropriate for the problem.
- **Follow-Up Questions:** During the interview, you may be asked additional questions regarding your code or alternative ways to solve the problem.

### 3. Grading Criteria
- **Correctness of Solutions (40%)**  
  Did you solve all the assigned questions accurately?

- **Clarity of Explanation (30%)**  
  How well can you articulate your problem-solving process and SQL knowledge?

- **Efficiency of Solutions (20%)**
