# SQL
### What to Do
* `setup.sql` is the file that was used to create the database. You can use it for reference, but do not modify or run it.
* `queries.sql` contains the assignment. Fill out the SQL queries in this file and run it.
* `example.db` is the database we are working with for this assignment.

### Working with SQLite3 in the Terminal
* `sqlite3 [dbname].db` to enter the SQLite3 shell. If the database doesn't exist already, it creates a new one.
* `.quit` to exit the shell.
* If you want to run an SQL file without entering the shell, then run `sqlite3 [dbname].db < [filename].sql`.

### SQLite3
* `.schema` displays the schema of the database.
